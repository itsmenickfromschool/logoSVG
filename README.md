# Nick's SVG Logo Maker

## Description
Create custom SVG logos with a simple command-line interface! This application allows users to input text, choose text and shape colors, and select a shape to generate a unique SVG logo. During the creation of this app I learned more about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and use of classes and inheritance.
